# My Take on solving Advent of Code 2016 questions using Haskell

I don't plan on keeping up with the [site](http://www.adventofcode.com) since I'm not that good at writing Haskell code. And it takes forever for me to complete a single answer because of the searches I make, or tutorials I read while coding the answer ;)

To solve your stuff, run:

`stack exec aoc2016 -- questionLabel input_file`

a `questionLabel` is `numerical Day` combined with `question id as a letter`, as in:
Day 1 - Question 2 : `1b`
